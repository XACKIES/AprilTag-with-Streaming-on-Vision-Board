## Introduction

Hi i am Mac , a 3rd-year Engineering student at KMUTT ( University in Thailand ). I recently learned about the Vision Board from TESA , then i think the Vision Board is enough for IoT system or Image processing on OpenMV IDE . If i have free time ,i will use this board in My Farm as a SMART Frame System .
