## Introduction

Hi i am Mac , a 3rd-year Engineering student at KMUTT ( University in Thailand ). I recently learned about the Vision Board from TESA , then i think the Vision Board is enough for IoT system or Image processing on [OpenMV IDE](https://openmv.io/pages/download?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAkc28BhB0EiwAM001TaVOXwbwnwOTVIMIaTtW5KEuo20ooDfVA1-7O-JSmRWFIvD3irmXmhoCvgkQAvD_BwE) . If i have free time ,i will use this board in My Farm as a SMART Frame System .
